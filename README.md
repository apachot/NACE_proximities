# NACE Proximities

We are interested in the proximities between two activity codes of the NACE Rev2 nomenclature. To measure these proximities, we analyzed the declarations of activity code changes made by firms over a long period. 
We extracted 29901 activity code changes declared by French establishments in the French NAF nomenclature that we converted into the European NACE nomenclature. 

Then, using Gephi software, we generated a representation in the form of a 2D graph.
